// Given the head of a singly linked list, find the length of the loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the length of the loop if it exists; otherwise, return 0. A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.

  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;

    // If we've seen this node before â†’ cycle detected
    if (seen.has(current)) {
      const loopEntry = current;
      let length = 1;
      let start = loopEntry.next;

      // Count how many nodes until we come back to loopEntry
      while (start !== loopEntry) {
        length++;
        start = start.next;
      }

      return length;
